# About Me

I am a PhD student with [the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eie/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Haibo Hu](http://www.haibohu.org/) ([ASTAPLE](http://www.astaple.com/)) and a visiting PhD student with [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), under the supervision of [Prof. Tianwei Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tianwei.zhang/). I received the Master's degree in computer technology with [the School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, in 2022, under the supervision of [Prof. Guyue Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li-Guyue). From April 2021 to September 2021, I worked as a Research Assistant with the Department of Computing, [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Bin Xiao (IEEE Fellow)](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csbxiao/).
